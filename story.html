    <h1><strong><b>St.benedict of nursia</b></strong></h1>

<p>Born at Nursia, c. 480; died at Monte Cassino, 543. The only authentic life of Benedict of Nursia is that contained in the second book of 06780aSt. Gregory's "Dialogues". It is rather a character sketch than a biography and consists, for the most part, of a number of 10338amiraculous incidents, which, although they illustrate the life of the 04171asaint, give little help towards a chronological account of his career. 06780aSt. Gregory's authorities for all that he relates were the 04171asaint's own disciples, viz. Constantinus, who succeeded him as 01015cAbbot of 10526bMonte Cassino; and Honoratus, who was 01015cAbbot of 14321aSubiaco when 06780aSt. Gregory wrote his "Dialogues".

<p>Benedict was the son of a Roman noble of Nursia, a small town near Spoleto, and a tradition, which 02384aSt. Bede accepts, makes him a twin with his sister Scholastica. His boyhood was spent in 13164aRome, where he lived with his 11478cparents and attended the 13554bschools until he had reached his higher studies. Then "giving over his books, and forsaking his 11478cfather's house and wealth, with a mind only to serve 06608aGod, he sought for some place where he might attain to the desire of his holy purpose; and in this sort he departed [from 13164aRome], instructed with learned 07648aignorance and furnished with unlearned wisdom" (Dial. St. Greg., II, Introd. in 10290aMigne, P.L. LXVI). There is much difference of opinion as to Benedict's age at the time. It has been very generally stated as fourteen, but a careful examination of 06780aSt. Gregory's narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than nineteen or twenty. He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected himself by the 09397alove of a 15687bwoman (Ibid. II, 2). He was capable of weighing all these things in comparison with the life taught in the Gospels, and chose the latter, He was at the beginning of life, and he had at his disposal the means to a career as a Roman noble; clearly he was not a child, As 06780aSt. Gregory expresses it, "he was in the world and was free to enjoy the advantages which the world offers, but drew back his foot which he had, as it were, already set forth in the world" (ibid., Introd.). If we accept the date 480 for his birth, we may fix the 04636cdate of his abandoning the 13554bschools and quitting home at about A.D. 500.

<p>Benedict does not seem to have left Rome for the purpose of becoming a 07280ahermit, but only to find some place away from the life of the great city; moreover, he took his old nurse with him as a servant and they settled down to live in Enfide, near a church dedicated to St. Peter, in some kind of association with "a company of virtuous men" who were in sympathy with his feelings and his views of life. Enfide, which the tradition of 14321aSubiaco identifies with the modern Affile, is in the Simbrucini mountains, about forty miles from 13164aRome and two from 14321aSubiaco. It stands on the crest of a ridge which rises rapidly from the valley to the higher range of mountains, and seen from the lower ground the village has the appearance of a fortress. As 06780aSt. Gregory's account indicates, and as is confirmed by the remains of the old town and by the inscriptions found in the neighbourhood, Enfide was a place of greater importance than is the present town. At Enfide Benedict worked his first 10338amiracle by restoring to perfect condition an earthenware wheat-sifter (<em>capisterium</em>) which his old servant had accidentally broken. The 11126bnotoriety which this 10338amiracle brought upon Benedict drove him to escape still farther from social life, and "he fled secretly from his nurse and sought the more retired district of 14321aSubiaco". His purpose of life had also been modified. He had fled 13164aRome to escape the evils of a great city; he now determined to be poor and to live by his own work. "For 06608aGod's sake he deliberately chose the hardships of life and the weariness of labour" (ibid., 1).

<p>A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to 14321aSubiaco. Crossing the Anio and turning to the right, the path rises along the left face oft the ravine and soon reaches the site of 10752cNero's villa and of the huge mole which formed the lower end of the middle lake; across the valley were ruins of the Roman baths, of which a few great arches and detached masses of wall still stand. Rising from the mole upon twenty five low arches, the foundations of which can even yet be traced, was the bridge from the villa to the baths, under which the waters of the middle lake poured in a wide fall into the lake below. The ruins of these vast buildings and the wide sheet of falling water closed up the entrance of the valley to St. Benedict as he came from Enfide; today the narrow valley lies open before us, closed only by the far off mountains. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until we reach a cave above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right hand it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in St. Benedict's day, five hundred feet below, lay the blue waters of the lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep. On his way from Enfide, Benedict met a 10487bmonk, Romanus, whose 04340cmonastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to 14321aSubiaco, and had given him the 10487bmonk's habit. By his advice Benedict became a 07280ahermit and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake. 06780aSt. Gregory tells us little of these years, He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (<em>puer</em>), but as a man (<em>vir</em>) of 06608aGod. Romanus, he twice tells us, served the 04171asaint in every way he could. The 10487bmonk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.

    <hardpoint="ad-cathen-middle" categories="4674472789+9174801043+7649576131">

<p>During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, he matured both in mind and character, in 08673aknowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the 01015cabbot of a 04340cmonastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with Vicovaro), the community came to him and begged him to become its 01015cabbot. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the 04340cmonastery, and 08673aknew that "their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent" (ibid., 3). The experiment failed; the 10487bmonks tried to poison him, and he returned to his cave. From this time his 10338amiracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his 07386asanctity and character, came to 14321aSubiaco to be under his guidance. For them he built in the valley twelve 04340cmonasteries, in each of which he placed a superior with twelve 10487bmonks. In a thirteenth he lived with "a few, such as he thought would more profit and be better instructed by his own presence" (ibid., 3). He remained, however, the father or 01015cabbot of all. With the establishment of these 04340cmonasteries began the 13554bschools for children; and amongst the first to be brought were Maurus and Placid.

<p>The remainder of St. Benedict's life was spent in realizing the ideal of monasticism which he has left us drawn out in his Rule, and before we follow the slight chronological story given by 06780aSt. Gregory, it will be better to examine the ideal, which, as 06780aSt. Gregory says, is St. Benedict's real biography (ibid., 36). We will deal here with the Rule only so far as it is an element in St. Benedict's life. For the relations which it bore to the monasticism of previous centuries, and for its influence throughout the West on civil and religious government, and upon the spiritual life of 03712aChristians, the reader is referred to the articles 10459aMONASTICISM and RULE OF SAINT BENEDICT.
<h2>The Benedictine rule</h2>

<p>1. Before studying 02436aSt. Benedict's Rule it is 10733anecessary to point out that it is written for 08748alaymen, not for 04049bclerics. The saint's purpose was not to institute an order of 04049bclerics with 04049bclerical 05215aduties and offices, but an organization and a set of rules for the domestic life of such 08748alaymen as wished to live as fully as possible the type of life presented in the Gospel. "My words", he says, "are addressed to thee, whoever thou art, that, renouncing thine own will, dost put on the strong and bright armour of obedience in order to fight for the Lord Christ, our 15073atrue King." (Prol. to Rule.) Later, the 03744aChurch imposed the 04049bclerical state upon 02443aBenedictines, and with the state came a preponderance of 04049bclerical and 12406asacerdotal 05215aduties, but the impress of the lay origin of the 02443aBenedictines has remained, and is perhaps the source of some of the characteristics which mark them off from later orders.

<p>2. Another characteristic feature of the 04171asaint's Rule is its view of work. His so-called order was not established to carry on any particular work or to meet any special special crisis in the 03744aChurch, as has been the case with other orders. With Benedict the work of his 10487bmonks was only a means to 06636bgoodness of life. The great disciplinary force for 09580chuman 10715anature is work; idleness is its ruin. The purpose of his Rule was to bring men "back to 06608aGod by the labour of obedience, from whom they had departed by the idleness of disobedience". Work was the first condition of all growth in 06636bgoodness. It was in order that his own life might be "wearied with labours for 06608aGod's sake" that St. Benedict left Enfide for the cave at 14321aSubiaco. It is 10733anecessary, comments 06780aSt. Gregory, that 06608aGod's elect should at the beginning, when life and 14504atemptations are strong in them, "be wearied with labour and pains". In the regeneration of 09580chuman 10715anature in the order of discipline, even 12345bprayer comes after work, for grace meets with no co-operation in the 14153asoul and heart of an idler. When the Goth "gave over the world" and went to 14321aSubiaco, St. Benedict gave him a bill-hook and set him to clear away briars for the making of a garden. <em>"Ecce! labora!"</em> go and work. Work is not, as the civilization of the time taught, the condition peculiar to slaves; it is the universal lot of man, 10733anecessary for his well-being as a man, and essential for him as a 03712aChristian.

<p>3. The 12748breligious life, as conceived by St. Benedict is essentially social. Life apart from one's fellows, the life of a 07280ahermit, if it is to be wholesome and sane, is possible only for a few, and these few must have reached an advanced stage of self-discipline while living with others (Rule, 1). The Rule, therefore, is entirely occupied with regulating the life of a community of men who live and work and 12345bpray and eat together, and this is not merely for a course of training, but as a permanent element of life at its best. The Rule conceives the superiors as always present and in constant touch with every member of the government, which is best described as patriarchal, or paternal (ibid., 2, 3, 64). The superior is the head of a 05782afamily; all are the permanent members of a household. Hence, too, much of the spiritual teaching of the Rule is concealed under legislation which seems purely social and domestic organization (ibid. 22-23, 35-41). So intimately connected with domestic life is the whole framework and teaching of the Rule that a 02443aBenedictine may be more truly said to enter or join a particular household than to join an order. The social character of 02443aBenedictine life has found expression in a fixed type for 04340cmonasteries and in the kind of works which 02443aBenedictines undertake, and it is secured by an absolute communism in possessions (ibid. 33, 34, 54, 55), by the rigorous suppression of all differences of worldly rank - "no one of noble birth may [for that reason] be put before him that was formerly a slave" (ibid. 2). and by the enforced presence of everyone at the routine 05215aduties of the household.

<p>4. Although private ownership is most strictly forbidden by the Rule, it was no part of St. Benedict's conception of monastic life that his 10487bmonks, as a body, should strip themselves of all wealth and live upon the 01328falms of the charitable; rather his purpose was to restrict the requirements of the individual to what was 10733anecessary and simple, and to secure that the use and administration of the corporate possessions should be in strict accord with the teaching of the Gospel. The 02443aBenedictine ideal of poverty is quite different from the 06217aFranciscan. The 02443aBenedictine takes no explicit 15511avow of poverty; he only 15511avows obedience according to the Rule. The rule allows all that is 10733anecessary to each individual, together with sufficient and varied clothing, abundant food (excluding only the flesh of quadrupeds), wine and ample sleep (ibid., 39, 40, 41, 55). Possessions could be held in common, they might be large, but they were to be administered for the furtherance of the work of the community and for the benefit of others. While the individual 10487bmonk was poor, the 04340cmonastery was to be in a position to give 01328falms, not to be compelled to seek them. It was to relieve the 12327apoor, to clothe the naked, to visit the sick, to bury the dead, to help the afflicted (ibid., 4), to entertain all strangers (ibid., 3). The poor came to Benedict to get help to pay their 04663bdebts (Dial. St. Greg., 27); they came for food (ibid., 21, 28).

<p>5. St. Benedict originated a form of government which is deserving of study. It is contained in chapters 2, 3, 31, 64, 65 of the Rule and in certain pregnant phrases scattered through other chapters. As with the Rule itself, so also his scheme of government is intended not for an order but for a single community. He presupposes that the community have bound themselves, by their promise of stability, to spend their lives together under the Rule. The superior is then elected by a free and universal suffrage. The government may be described as a monarchy, with the Rule as its constitution. Within the four corners of the Rule everything is left to the discretion of the 01015cabbot, the abuse of whose authority is checked by religion (Rule, 2), by open debate with the community on all important matters, and with its representative elders in smaller concerns (ibid., 3). The reality of these checks upon the wilfulness of the ruler can be appreciated only when it is remembered that ruler and community were bound together for life, that all were inspired by the single purpose of carrying out the conception of life taught in the Gospel, and that the relation of the members of the community to one another and to the 01015cabbot, and of the 01015cabbot to them, were elevated and spiritualized by a 10663bmysticism which set before itself the acceptance of the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount as real and work-a-day 15073atruths.

<p>6. (a) When a 03712aChristian household, a community, has been organized by the willing acceptance of its social 05215aduties and responsibilities, by obedience to an authority, and, further, is under the continuous discipline of work and self-denial, the next step in the regeneration of its members in their return to 06608aGod is 12345bprayer. The Rule deals directly and explicitly only with public 12345bprayer. For this Benedict assigns the Psalms and Canticles, with readings from the Scriptures and Fathers. He devotes eleven chapters out of the seventy-three of his Rule to regulating this public 12345bprayer, and it is characteristic of the freedom of his Rule and of the "moderation" of the 04171asaint, that he concludes his very careful directions by saying that if any superior does not like his arrangement he is free to make another; this only he says he will insist on, that the whole 12543bPsalter will be said in the course of a week. The practice of the holy Fathers, he adds, was resolutely "to say in a single day what I 12345bpray we tepid 10487bmonks may get through in a whole week" (ibid., 18). On the other hand, he checks indiscreet 15753azeal by laying down the general rule "that 12345bprayer made in common must always be short" (ibid., 20). It is very difficult to reduce St. Benedict's teaching on 12345bprayer to a system, for this reason, that in his conception of the 03712aChristian character, 12345bprayer is coexistent with the whole life, and life is not complete at any point unless penetrated by 12345bprayer. .

<p>(b) The form of 12345bprayer which thus covers the whole of our waking hours, St. Benedict calls the first degree of 07543bhumility. It consists in realizing the 12396apresence of God (ibid., 7). The first step begins when the spiritual is joined to the merely human, or, as the 04171asaint expresses it, it is the first step in a ladder, the rungs of which rest at one end in the body and at the other in the 14153asoul. The ability to exercise this form of 12345bprayer is fostered by that care of the "heart" on which the 04171asaint so often insists; and the heart is saved from the dissipation that would result from social intercourse by the habit of mind which sees in everyone 08374cChrist Himself. "Let the sick be served in very deed as 08374cChrist Himself" (ibid., 36). "Let all guests that come be received as 08374cChrist" (ibid., 53). "Whether we be slaves or freemen, we are all one in 08374cChrist and bear an equal rank in the service of 08374cOur Lord" (ibid., 2).

<p>(c) Secondly, there is public 12345bprayer. This is short and is to be said at intervals, at night and at seven distinct hours during the day, so that, when possible, there shall be no great interval without a call to formal, vocal, 12345bprayer (ibid., 16). The position which St. Benedict gave to public, common 12345bprayer can best be described by saying that he established it as the centre of the common life to which he bound his 10487bmonks. It was the 04276aconsecration, not only of the individual, but of the whole community to 06608aGod by the oft-repeated daily public acts of 05752cfaith. and of praise and adoration of the Creator; and this public worship of 06608aGod, the <em>opus Dei</em>, was to form the chief work of his 10487bmonks, and to be the source from which all other works took their inspiration, their direction, and their strength.

<p>(d) Lastly, there is private 12345bprayer, for which the 04171asaint does not legislate. It follows individual gifts - "If anyone wishes to 12345bpray in private, let him go quietly into the oratory and 12345bpray, not with a loud voice, but with tears and fervour of heart" (ibid., 52). "Our 12345bprayer ought to be short and with purity of heart, except it be perchance prolonged by the inspiration of divine grace" (ibid., 20). But if St. Benedict gives no further directions on private 12345bprayer, it is because the whole condition and mode of life secured by the Rule, and the character formed by its observance, lead naturally to the higher states of 12345bprayer. As the Saint writes: "Whoever, therefore, thou art that hastenest to thy heavenly country, fulfil by the help of Christ this little Rule which we have written for beginners; and then at length thou shalt arrive, under 06608aGod's protection, at the lofty summits of 05075bdoctrine and virtue of which we have spoken above" (ibid., 73). for guidance in these higher states the Saint refers to the Fathers, Basil and Cassian.

<p>From this short examination of the Rule and its system of 12345bprayer, it will be obvious that to describe the 02443aBenedictine as a contemplative order is misleading, if the word is used in its modern technical sense as excluding active work; the "contemplative" is a form of life framed for different circumstances and with a different object from St. Benedict's. The Rule, including its system of 12345bprayer and public psalmody, is meant for every class of mind and every degree of learning. It is framed not only for the 05295beducated and for 14153asouls advanced in perfection, but it organizes and directs a complete life which is adapted for simple folk and for sinners, for the observance of the Commandments and for the beginnings of 06636bgoodness. "We have written this Rule", writes St. Benedict, "that by observing it in 04340cmonasteries, we may shew ourselves to have some degree of 06636bgoodness in life and a beginning of 07386aholiness. But for him who would hasten to the perfection of religion, there are the teachings of the holy Fathers, the following whereof bringeth a man to the height of perfection" (ibid., 73). Before leaving the subject of 12345bprayer it will be well to point out again that by ordering the public recitation and singing of the 12543bPsalter, St. Benedict was not putting upon his 10487bmonks a distinctly 04049bclerical 11189aobligation. The 12543bPsalter was the common form of 12345bprayer of all 03712aChristians; we must not read into his Rule characteristics which a later age and discipline have made inseparable from the public recitation of the 11219aDivine Office.

<p>We can now take up again the story of Benedict's life. How long he remained at 14321aSubiaco we do not 08673aknow. 14788cAbbot Tosti conjectures it was until the year 529. Of these years 06780aSt. Gregory is content to tell no more than a few stories descriptive of the life of the 10487bmonks, and of the character and government of St. Benedict. The latter was making his first attempt to realize in these twelve 04340cmonasteries his conception of the monastic life. We can fill in many of the details from the Rule. By his own experiment and his 08673aknowledge of the history of monasticism the 04171asaint had learnt that the regeneration of the individual, except in abnormal cases, is not reached by the path of solitude, nor by that of austerity, but by the beaten path of man's social 08050binstinct, with its 10733anecessary conditions of obedience and work; and that neither the body nor the mind can be safely overstrained in the effort to avoid 05649aevil (ibid., 64). Thus, at 14321aSubiaco we find no solitaries, no conventual 07280ahermits, no great austerities, but men living together in organized communities for the purpose of leading good lives, doing such work as came to their hand - carrying water up the steep mountain-side, doing the other household work, raising the twelve 04060acloisters, clearing the ground, making gardens, teaching children, preaching to the country people, reading and studying at least four hours a day, receiving strangers, accepting and training new-comers, attending the regular hours of 12345bprayer, reciting and chanting the 12543bPsalter. The life at 14321aSubiaco and the character of St. Benedict attracted many to the new 04340cmonasteries, and with their increasing numbers and growing influence came the inevitable jealousy and 11703apersecution, which culminated with a vile attempt of a neighboring 12406apriest to 13506dscandalize the 10487bmonks by an exhibition of naked 15687bwomen, dancing in the courtyard of the 04171asaint's 04340cmonastery (Dial. St. Greg., 8). To save his followers from further 11703apersecution Benedict left 14321aSubiaco and went to 10526bMonte Cassino.

<p>Upon the crest of 10526bMonte Cassino "there was an ancient 03574bchapel in which the foolish and simple country people, according to the custom of the old 06422aGentiles, worshipped the god Apollo. Round about it likewise upon all sides there were woods for the service of 04764adevils, in which, even to that very time, the mad multitude of infidels did offer most wicked sacrifice. The man of 06608aGod, coming hither, beat in pieces the idol, overthrew the altar, set fire on the woods and in the temple of Apollo built the oratory of St. Martin: and where the altar of the same Apollo was, he made an oratory of St. John: and by his continual preaching he brought the people dwelling in those parts to embrace the 05752cfaith of 08374cChrist" (ibid., 8). On this spot the 04171asaint built his 04340cmonastery. His experience at 14321aSubiaco had led him to alter his plans, and now, instead of building several houses with a small community in each, he kept all his 10487bmonks in one 04340cmonastery and provided for its government by appointing a prior and deans (Rule, 65, 21). We find no trace in his Rule, which was most probably written at 10526bMonte Cassino, of the view which guided him when he built the twelve small 04340cmonasteries at 14321aSubiaco. The life which we have witnessed at 14321aSubiaco was renewed at 10526bMonte Cassino, but the change in the situation and local conditions brought a corresponding modification in the work undertaken by the 10487bmonks. 14321aSubiaco was a retired valley away in the mountains and difficult of access; Cassino was on one of the great highways to the south of 08208aItaly, and at no great distance from 03319aCapua. This brought the 04340cmonastery into more frequent communication with the outside world. It soon became a centre of influence in a district in which there was a large population, with several 05001adioceses and other 04340cmonasteries. Abbots came to see and advise with Benedict. Men of all classes were frequent visitors, and he numbered nobles and 02581bbishops among his intimate friends. There were 11164anuns in the neighbourhood whom the 10487bmonks went to preach to and to teach. There was a village nearby in which St. Benedict preached and made many converts (Dial. St. Greg., 19). The 04340cmonastery became the protector of the 12327apoor, their trustee (ibid., 31), their refuge in sickness, in trial, in accidents, in want.

<p>Thus during the life of the 04171asaint we find what has ever since remained a characteristic feature of 02443aBenedictine houses, i.e. the members take up any work which is adapted to their peculiar circumstances, any work which may be dictated by their necessities. Thus we find the 02443aBenedictines teaching in poor 13554bschools and in the 15188auniversities, practising the arts and following agriculture, undertaking the care of 14153asouls, or devoting themselves wholly to study. No work is foreign to the 02443aBenedictine, provided only it is compatible with living in community and with the performance of the 11219aDivine Office. This freedom in the choice of work was 10733anecessary in a Rule which was to be suited to all times and places, but it was primarily the natural result of the end which St. Benedict had in view, and in which he differs from the founders of later orders. These later had in view some special work to which they wished their disciples to devote themselves; St. Benedict's purpose was only to provide a Rule by which anyone might follow the Gospel counsels, and live, and work and 12345bpray, and save his 14153asoul. 06780aSt. Gregory's narrative of the establishment of 10526bMonte Cassino does little more for us than to supply disconnected incidents which illustrate the daily life of the 04340cmonastery. We gain only a few biographical facts. From 10526bMonte Cassino St. Benedict founded another 04340cmonastery near 14518cTerracina, on the coast, about forty miles distant (ibid., 22). To the wisdom of long experience and to the mature virtues of the 04171asaint, was now added the gift of prophecy, of which 06780aSt. Gregory gives many examples. Celebrated among these is the story of the visit of Totila, King of the 11347dGoths, in the year 543, when the 04171asaint "rebuked him for his wicked deeds, and in a few words told him all that should befall him, saying 'Much wickedness do you daily commit, and many 14004bsins have you done: now at length give over your 14004bsinful life. Into the city of 13164aRome shall you enter, and over the sea shall you pass: nine years shall you reign, and in the tenth shall you leave this mortal life.' The king, hearing these things, was wonderfully afraid, and desiring the holy man to commend him to 06608aGod in his 12345bprayers he departed: and from that time forward he was nothing so cruel as before he had been. Not long after he went to 13164aRome, sailed over into 13772aSicily, and in the tenth year of his reign he lost his kingdom together with his life." (ibid., 15).

<p>Totila's visit to 10526bMonte Cassino in 543 is the only certain date we have in the 04171asaint's life. It must have occurred when Benedict was advanced in age. 14788cAbbot Tosti, following others, puts the 04171asaint's death in the same year. Just before his death we hear for the first time of his sister Scholastica. "She had been dedicated from her infancy to 08374cOur Lord, and used to come once a year to visit her brother. To whom the man of 06608aGod went not far from the gate to a place that did belong to the 01010aabbey, there to give her entertainment" (ibid., 33). They met for the last time three days before Scholastica's death, on a day "when the sky was so clear that no cloud was to be seen". The sister begged her brother to stay the night, "but by no persuasion would he agree unto that, saying that he might not by any means tarry all night out of his 01010aabbey.... The 11164anun receiving this denial of her brother, joining her hands together, laid them on the table; and so bowing her head upon them, she made her 12345bprayers to 06608aAlmighty God, and lifting her head from the table, there fell suddenly such a tempest of lightening and thundering, and such abundance of rain, that neither venerable Bennet, nor the 10487bmonks that were with him, could put their head out of door" (ibid., 33). Three days later, "Benedict beheld the 14153asoul of his sister, which was departed from her body, in the likeness of a dove, to ascend into 07170aheaven: who rejoicing much to see her great glory, with 07595ahymns and lauds gave thanks to 06608aAlmighty God, and did impart news of this her death to his 10487bmonks whom also he sent presently to bring her corpse to his 01010aabbey, to have it buried in that grave which he had provided for himself" (ibid., 34).

<p>It would seem to have been about this time that St. Benedict had that wonderful vision in which he came as near to seeing 06608aGod as is possible for man in this life. 06780aSt. Gregory and 02648cSt. Bonaventure say that Benedict saw 06608aGod and in that vision of 06608aGod saw the whole world. 14663bSt. Thomas will not allow that this could have been. 15218bUrban VIII, however, does not hesitate to say that "the saint merited while still in this mortal life, to see 06608aGod Himself and in 06608aGod all that is below him". If he did not see the Creator, he saw that light which is in the Creator, and in that light, as 06780aSt. Gregory says, "saw the whole world gathered together as it were under one beam of the sun. At the same time he saw the 14153asoul of Germanus, 02581bBishop of 03319aCapua, in a fiery globe carried up by the 01476dangels to 07170aHeaven" (ibid., 35). Once more the hidden things of 06608aGod were shown to him, and he warned his brethren, both "those that lived daily with him and those that dwelt far off" of his approaching death. "Six days before he left this world he gave orders to have his sepulchre opened, and forthwith falling into an ague, he began with burning heat to wax faint; and when as the sickness daily increased, upon the sixth day he commanded his 10487bmonks to carry him into the oratory, where he did arm himself receiving the 05572cBody and Blood of our Saviour Christ; and having his weak body holden up betwixt the hands of his disciples, he stood with his own hands lifted up to 07170aheaven; and as he was in that manner 12345bpraying, he gave up the ghost" (ibid., 37). He was 03071aburied in the same grave with his sister "in the oratory of St. John the Baptist, which [he] himself had built when he overthrew the altar of Apollo" (ibid.). There is some 05141adoubt whether the 12734arelics of the 04171asaint are still at 10526bMonte Cassino, or whether they were moved in the seventh century to Fleury. 14788cAbbot Tosti in his life of St. Benedict, discusses the question at length (chap. xi) and decides the controversy in favour of 10526bMonte Cassino.

<p>Perhaps the most striking characteristics in St. Benedict are his deep and wide human feeling and his moderation. The former reveals itself in the many anecdotes recorded by 06780aSt. Gregory. We see it in his sympathy and care for the simplest of his 10487bmonks; his hastening to the help of the poor Goth who had lost his bill-hook; spending the hours of the night in 12345bprayer on the mountain to save his 10487bmonks the labour of carrying water, and to remove from their lives a "just cause of grumbling"; staying three days in a 04340cmonastery to help to induce one of the 10487bmonks to "remain quietly at his prayers as the other monks did", instead of going forth from the 03574bchapel and wandering about "busying himself with some earthly and transitory things". He lets the crow from the neighboring woods come daily when all are at dinner to be fed by himself. His mind is always with those who are absent; sitting in his cell he knows that Placid is fallen into the lake; he foresees the accident to the builders and sends a warning to them; in spirit and some kind of real presence he is with the 10487bmonks "eating and refreshing themselves" on their journey, with his friend Valentinian on his way to the 04340cmonastery, with the 10487bmonk taking a present from the 11164anuns, with the new community in 14518cTerracina. Throughout 06780aSt. Gregory's narrative he is always the same quiet, gentle, dignified, strong, peace-loving man who by the subtle power of sympathy becomes the centre of the lives and interests of all about him. We see him with his 10487bmonks in the church, at their reading, sometimes in the fields, but more commonly in his cell, where frequent messengers find him "weeping silently in his 12345bprayers", and in the night hours standing at "the window of his cell in the tower, offering up his 12345bprayers to 06608aGod"; and often, as Totila found him, sitting outside the door of his cell, or "before the gate of the 04340cmonastery reading a book". He has given his own portrait in his ideal picture of an 01015cabbot (Rule, 64): <blockquote> It beseemeth the 01015cabbot to be ever doing some good for his brethren rather than to be presiding over them. He must, therefore, be learned in the 09053alaw of 06608aGod, that he may 08673aknow whence to bring forth things new and old; he must be chaste, sober, and merciful, ever preferring mercy to 08571cjustice, that he himself may obtain mercy. Let him hate 14004bsin and 09397alove the brethren. And even in his corrections, let him act with 12517bprudence, and not go too far, lest while he seeketh too eagerly to scrape off the rust, the vessel be broken. Let him keep his own frailty ever before his eyes, and remember that the bruised reed must not be broken. And by this we do not mean that he should suffer vices to grow up; but that prudently and with charity he should cut them off, in the way he shall see best for each, as we have already said; and let him study rather to be 09397aloved than feared. Let him not be violent nor over anxious, not exacting nor obstinate, not jealous nor prone to suspicion, or else he will never be at rest. In all his commands, whether spiritual or temporal, let him be prudent and considerate. In the works which he imposeth let him be discreet and moderate, bearing in mind the discretion of holy Jacob, when he said: 'If I cause my flocks to be overdriven, they will all perish in one day'. Taking, then, such testimonies as are borne by these and the like words to discretion, the mother of virtues, let him so temper all things, that the strong may have something to strive after, and the weak nothing at which to take alarm.</blockquote>
